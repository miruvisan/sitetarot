        <h3>
            Pamela Colman Smith Was the Artist and Occultist Who Designed the Iconic Tarot Deck. Why Has No One Ever
            Heard Her Name?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Pamela Colman Smith's illustrations for the 1909 Rider-Waite Tarot deck transformed tarot art. Her vivid,
            symbolic designs, blending her background in painting and stage design, made the cards accessible and
            intuitive. Smith’s influence reshaped tarot imagery, establishing her as a key figure in its modern
            interpretation.

                <div class="inner">
                    <p>At its core, Tarot is a tool for divination—a way of seeking guidance through symbols,
                        archetypes, and intuitive readings. The Tarot deck consists of 78 cards, each with its own
                        unique imagery and message. While Tarot has roots in the 15th century, its spiritual
                        significance has evolved, and it is now used not only for fortune-telling but as a means for
                        introspection, self-discovery, and spiritual growth. Every card in the deck carries with it both
                        a traditional meaning and an opportunity for personal interpretation, making each reading an
                        intimate and personalized experience.</p>
